This framework helps you to:

* design interfaces for futuristic smart screens, touch tables and HUDs.
* implement user interfaces for long life application and productivity based on maximum ergonomy and timeless design
* increase efficiency with adaptive interfaces based on human experience

## Getting started

This framework is currently available for React with [react-aldebarion](https://github.com/aldebarion/react-aldebarion).

It is also planned to be available on Vue.js and maybe some 3D javascript engines for VR.

## Guidelines

You must follow aldebarion guidelines in order to get a continuity in user experience.

### Minimalism

* kind of scandinavian refined style
* limit of austere
* clean
* straight

### Efficiency

* give priority to efficiency
* long-term interface

### Multi devices

* ensure responsiveness compatible with all platforms including computers, smartphone, tablets, large screens, ambient devices and HUDs.
* use a minimal set of contrasted colors to manage even the most lightning environments
* ensure continuity between devices: the user can begin on one device and then switch to another device without degradation of experience

### Ergonomy

* accompany the look of the user: display everything with transition
* do not use no frills except to catch the user attention
* use geometrical shapes
* integrate several levels of reading
