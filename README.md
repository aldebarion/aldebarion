Aldebarion helps frontend developers to focus on most valued features in user
interfaces.

Users expect usable, accessible and efficient user interfaces and in particular
sign-in forms, sign-up forms, etc. But it takes time
to implement them. But users don't care if behaviors are similar between websites.
So Aldebarion provides opinionated components including the best interaction standards

The aestheticism of your website is part of your brand. So Aldebarion provides
highly customizable components.

## Ux Guidelines

### Heuristics

All Adelbarion components are designed to follow following heuritics:

- **minimalism**: display only necessary information
- **error prevention**: prevent user mistakes or help him to recover from errors very fast
- **feedbacks**: give feedbacks to every user interactions
- **constraints**: limit at maximum user interaction possibilities to avoid him
  to make mistakes
- **affordance**: how to use components should be self explaining by the
  component visual

> Aldebarion heuritics are inspired from [Don
> Norman heuristics](https://medium.com/@sachinrekhi/don-normans-principles-of-interaction-design-51025a2c0f33)
> and [Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).
