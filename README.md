Aldebarion is a frontend framework opinionated about usability features
and highly customizable about style. It also makes React components easier to
manipulate as a developer.

It is opinionated because it integrates the best standards for form validation,
accessibility, etc: all the things your users expect but don't notice. It will
save your time and energy.

It is highly customizable because it includes several themes and can be updated
using LESS, SASS, CSS or JS-based styles.

One more thing ! Even if all Aldebarion components are optimized to work
together, you can integrate a specific component without messing up the style of
the rest of your application, at the opposite of a lot of frameworks,

## Getting started
