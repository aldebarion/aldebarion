# Themes

In order to create applications compatible with all devices including hologram, projections and HUDs,
you need interfaces with high contrast so we advise you to use the following themes.

## Moon light

The moon light theme is the default theme. It is a dark theme compatible with most of standard screens
like smartphones, tablet, table, computers.

In order to activate this theme : add class "moon-light" to the `body` tag.


## Awakening

The awakening theme is the light theme compatible with interfaces without backgrounds like HUDs and hologram.

In order to activate this theme : add class "awakening" to the `body` tag.

If you want to active transparency for background in order to use the theme for HUDs or holograms : add class "no-background" to the `body` tag.
